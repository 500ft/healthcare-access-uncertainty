# Results

Exported figures and analysis outputs.

The main [`README`](../../README.md) displays the synthetic method demonstration.
**`ndvi_change.png`** remains a legacy full-field-rendering placeholder in this
directory. Do not replace it with a claimed result until
the sites are verified and the pre-registered Phase-1 gate outcome is recorded.

## Workflow

1. **Verify** — freeze dated reference-imagery provenance for all three development
   sites and `negative-01` in [`../config/sites.geojson`](../../config/sites.geojson).
2. **Gate** — run [`../gee/ndvi_change.js`](../../gee/ndvi_change.js) at those four
   registered sites. Preserve each one-row gate-metrics CSV and apply the exact
   2× large-component-fraction rule in [`../docs/design.md`](../design.md).
3. **Generate** — only after preserving the primary metrics, click the candidate
   thumbnail URL or use the raster Drive export for the figure input.
4. **Compose** — turn the raw export into a self-contained figure with a title,
   legend, scale bar, and the required attribution:

   ```bash
   python tools/compose_figure.py \
     --input path/to/gee_export.png \
     --title "Persistent candidate disturbance around <place>" \
     --years "2018-2021 -> 2023-2026" \
     --region "<region>, Mongolia" \
     --scale 10 \
     --year-attr "2018-2021, 2023-2026" \
     --output results/ndvi_change.png
   ```
5. **Report** the gate result next to the figure, including the negative-control
   metric, development-site metrics, coverage, and whether the registered rule
   passed. A failed gate is a valid result; do not replace it with a sensitivity run.

## Attribution & licensing

Sentinel-2 imagery is free and openly licensed (Copernicus). When you publish a
figure, include: *"Contains modified Copernicus Sentinel-2 data (`<years>`),
processed in Google Earth Engine."* `compose_figure.py` bakes this line in.

Do **not** commit raw imagery exports here — GeoTIFFs and archives are ignored by
`.gitignore` to keep the repo light. Keep only finished figures.



## `extractor_stress_cases.json` — where the extractor detects, misses, fabricates, or misrepresents (CR-R03 → R03c → CR-09, 2026-09-16)

Ten fixed synthetic cases (`analysis/catanroads/stress_cases.py`), each with a road-area truth mask **and a 1-px reference centerline**, scored on two layers that must not be confused: the *component* layer (the extractor's internal mask vs the road-area truth, within 2 px) and the *delivered-line* layer (the geometry the extractor exports — since CR-09 the `path_px` polyline — **vs the reference centerline**, within 2 px, two 4-neighbour dilations). `chord_line` re-scores the legacy straight `endpoints_px` chord through the same scorer, so the pre-CR-09 line layer stays visible; `area_coverage` (how much of the road-area mask the delivered band covers) is a separate diagnostic and never enters `line_ok`. Regenerate with `PYTHONPATH=analysis python -m catanroads.stress_cases --out results/extractor_stress_cases.json` (schema v4 with provenance metadata), which stages a temporary file beside the destination, validates it by parsing it back, and only then replaces the record; a plain shell redirect truncates the committed record if the run fails mid-way, so `--out` is the documented path; `tests/test_stress_cases.py` pins the observed behaviour and the frozen CR-09 acceptance targets. `extractor_stress_cases_baseline_2026-09-12.json` (v1) and `extractor_stress_cases_baseline_v3_2026-09-14.json` (v3) are kept byte-unchanged and hash-tested. **Synthetic constructions only — nothing here is imagery or a site result.**

**Four records.** (v1) component layer only. (v2) the component score is blind to the exported geometry, so a line layer was added; `width_px` is the component's minor-axis *extent*, 54.7 px for the curved corridor at zero noise. (v3) the line layer is scored against the reference centerline, not the road-area mask, so a perfect centerline scores 1.0 regardless of road width. (v4, CR-09) the delivered geometry is `path_px`, one interior-biased route per accepted component (padded-crop distance transform, symmetric `1/edt` edge cost, single-source Dijkstra, every vertex kept; endpoints per plan amendment A), and the chord result is retained as `chord_line`. Every curved corridor that failed the chord (0.11 / 0.25 / 0.44) now passes at ≥ 0.93 recall with ≥ 0.99 precision; straight cases are within their frozen allowances; component-layer numbers are identical across all four records. Three declared sensitivity seeds are recorded under `sensitivity_seeds`, unturned.

What still fails, by construction: crossings and dashes are missed (elongation and minimum-length filters); the river-bank confound is fabricated; the faint corridor is still delivered as seven pieces; one route per component cannot represent junctions, loops or braids. Recorded in [the CR-09 evidence](../../evidence/task-2026-09-14/README.md).
