# CatanRoads — partial handoff, local software ready for review

## Runtime follow-up — 2026-09-29

The grid probe and the unchanged default Phase-1 script were executed in the
signed-in Earth Engine Code Editor. The probe's geometry-unit, footprint and
unsupported-kernel-method defects are fixed. Its measured support and resampling
order findings, the original failure, and the QA console/export states live in
[the runtime record](../results/earth_engine_runtime_2026-09-29.json).
Recheck the captured geometry with `python tools/check_grid_runtime.py`; this
local check does not rerun Earth Engine.

CR-08 remains blocked on dated reference imagery and owner site judgment.
The default development run is unverified QA; it establishes no screen verdict.
Production configuration and verification flags are unchanged. The compositor
order experiment is a raw-band diagnostic, not completion of the index-based
real-data A/B comparison.

## Closeout — 2026-09-25 (Day 6, completed 2026-09-25 not 2026-09-24)

The following is the historical preparation snapshot; the runtime record above
supersedes its access and execution status.

Preparation work for this repository is complete. **Research completion is not claimed.** No site is
verified, no Earth Engine run has occurred, and the registered Phase-1 screen has never been
executed on real data.

Full closeout detail: [evidence/task-2026-09-25/README.md](../evidence/task-2026-09-25/README.md).

**The one next focus:** acquire the missing reference and runtime evidence, then execute the
registered Phase-1 screen when eligible. Topology is not scheduled merely because data access takes
longer; if access stalls, reassess access feasibility rather than substituting algorithm work.

**What is still required, and from whom.** One authorized dated scene reference and an actual
judgment for `dev-01-braided`, or an explicit statement of which registered control is available
instead. Access to an authorized Earth Engine project, or the completed export artifacts from the
prepared probe. Review of the corrected #37 and of the closeout PR.


## Latest follow-up — 2026-09-16 (CR-R03 stack and CR-09)

- **CR-R03 → R03c** (PRs #12–#14, merged 2026-09-13): ten fixed synthetic stress cases with
  their own truth masks and reference centerlines; component layer and delivered-line layer
  scored separately. [Evidence](../evidence/task-2026-09-12/README.md).
- **Editing convention** (PRs #15–#16, 2026-09-14): [ponytail ruleset](../AGENTS.md); two
  refactor passes, behaviour and records unchanged.
- **CR-09** (plan #17 superseded by the reviewed #18; build #19 reverted in #20; feasibility
  stop #20/#21; completed build **#22, pending owner review**): each accepted component is
  delivered as one interior-biased `path_px` route; curved corridors pass the frozen line-layer
  targets; component layer unchanged. [Plan](PLAN_2026-09-14_CR09.md) ·
  [Evidence](../evidence/task-2026-09-14/README.md).
- **CR-08 intake path re-checked 2026-09-16** (no site inspected): worksheet regenerates
  consistently, the manifest admission fields (`verified`, `ref_imagery_date`, `provenance`) are
  mirrored in `gee/ndvi_change.js` and statically validated, the runbook's gate command is
  exercised end to end by tests, and all six site flags remain `false`. The first dated
  development/control judgment can be applied as a reviewable manifest diff, then the worksheet
  regenerated and the Earth Engine `SITES` block mirrored, per
  [COMPLETION_RECONCILIATION.md](COMPLETION_RECONCILIATION.md).

Counts below are historical snapshots; the current suite is 116 tests on PR #22.

## Day-3 preparation — 2026-09-09

Five generated-worksheet tests cover holdout omission, unchanged eligibility, future site inclusion, duplicate IDs and committed output consistency. 63 analysis tests and both Node checks pass. All six sites remain unverified; no imagery or Earth Engine evaluation occurred.

Review [DAY3_PLAN.md](https://github.com/500ft/informal-road-mapping/blob/20303f6f9c707a7daa691e0c821ce4a46bec2005/docs/DAY3_PLAN.md), [deliverable](SITE_VERIFICATION_WORKSHEET.md), and [commands/evidence](../evidence/task-day3-2026-09-09/README.md). Base: `346b942b6de2ade58d40f2dfe367cbd086370d87`; new PR branch: `task/day-three-20260909`. No original Owner/External gate is closed. Final source identity is the PR head, reported in its delivery record rather than embedded circularly here.

No feature confirmation without seeing the dated source image; no Earth Engine or holdout evaluation implied.

## Review follow-up — 2026-09-09

The day-2 rehearsal now preserves literal file paths; 58 tests pass locally.
See [review evidence and limitations](../evidence/review-2026-09-09/README.md).
Older counts below are historical snapshots, not the amended candidate.

## Latest follow-up — 2026-09-09

[CR-D02 runbook rehearsal](../evidence/task-2026-09-09/README.md): the documented Phase-1
gate command is now executed by tests on synthetic fixtures, so runbook and CLI cannot drift
apart; 55 tests pass. No real-data result; CR-08 remains the gate.

## Latest follow-up — 2026-09-08

[CR-D01 temporal QA review](../evidence/task-2026-09-08/README.md) supersedes the
old intake interface for current use. Eight scene-count columns are now required;
48 Python tests and two Node checks pass locally. Original sprint evidence below
is historical and hash-bound. Real-data evaluation remains blocked on CR-08.

Prepared 2026-09-05; resumed and checked 2026-09-06. Budget: six workload days,
30 focused hours per repository; estimates are not recorded time spent.

## Completed deliverables and evidence

The new intake rejects unverified references, missing/duplicate metrics, non-finite values, mismatched settings, invalid AOIs, impossible component/coverage fractions and malformed CSV headers/rows. Registered thresholds and site flags are unchanged. Workflow is installed locally.

Implementation: [intake](../analysis/catanroads/phase1_gate.py), [tests](../analysis/tests/test_phase1_gate.py), [runbook](PHASE1_RUNBOOK.md), [workflow](../.github/workflows/ci.yml).

- [Baseline identity, commands and outputs](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/baseline.json).
- [Original failing evidence](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/intake-red.json).
- [Implementation checks](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/implementation-green.json).
- [Final verification](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/final-checks.json).
- [Predeclared evaluation procedure](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/evaluation-plan.md),
  [retained replay](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/evaluate_candidate.py),
  [actual outputs](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/evaluation.json).
- [Three review-discovered failures, now regressions](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/reviewer-red.json).

- [Consumer delivery evidence](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/consumer.json).

35 tests passed (9 existing plus26 intake cases); static GEE validator passed; 6/6 installed-CLI cases matched.

No Earth Engine run, verified Mongolia site, road accuracy estimate or hosted Actions execution. Metadata labels/hashes cannot authenticate imagery. Positive disturbance is not recovery or stable-track detection.

## Reproduce

Run from the canonical checkout using the recorded Python3.11 environment and
repository dependencies. The local pytest workaround stubs readline before import;
it is not a skipped test or changed product requirement.

```sh
PYTHONPATH=analysis python -c 'import sys, types; sys.modules["readline"] = types.ModuleType("readline"); import pytest; raise SystemExit(pytest.main(["-q"]))'
node tools/validate_phase1.mjs
python evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/evaluate_candidate.py
git diff --check
```


Delivery route: editable catanroads0.1.0 installed with `python -m pip install -e ./analysis --no-deps --no-build-isolation`; dependencies were already available. CLI replay launches from temporary consumer directories. This is not a fresh-environment or registry-publication claim.


No separate configured lint/typecheck is claimed. Syntax checks are compilation,
not static typing. Saved output truncation, if present, is indicated by the tool
result metadata; no omitted output is called a full log.

## Evaluation meaning and remaining work

Selected implementation/protocol hashes and expectations were saved before the
additional cases ran. Existing tests, reviewed fixtures and reviewer-discovered
bugs are development material. All additional cases were retained. These small
developer-selected checks establish behavior on those inputs, not independent
scientific validation or general accuracy. Another agent is not a human reviewer.
External feedback: pending.

1. Owner verifies dated imagery for existing development/control sites before gate predictions; no post-hoc site swap.
2. Obtain actual GEE exports and scene/coverage provenance; real-data evaluation remains blocked.
3. Hosted workflow needs an authorized push with workflow permission; network-conditioned detection is future research.

Next action: CR-08: provide dated site verification and actual GEE exports per docs/PHASE1_RUNBOOK.md.

Evidence-supported portfolio bullet: “Implemented and tested a fail-closed satellite-screening intake that separates unverified QA and synthetic examples from eligible disturbance-screen results.”
This concerns engineering quality, not adoption or measured scientific performance.
