# Bibliography

Grouped by theme. Each entry: citation, one-line finding, why it matters here, **A**boutness 0–3,
**E**vidence A–D, and **transcription confidence** (see [README](README.md) for the grades and the
verification policy). Entries marked *unverified* on a field were not confirmed against the
publisher record — do not cite those fields externally without checking.

Retrieved 2026-09-22 by eight parallel searches. The session's web-search budget was exhausted
partway through; several clusters finished verification through the Crossref API, which confirms
bibliographic fields precisely but discovers less well than full-text search. See [gaps.md](gaps.md).

Sections 1 to 14 predate the 2026-10-08 rename and have not been re-assessed against the current
question; see the [2026-10-09 note](README.md#note-2026-10-09). Section 15 holds the entries added

## 1. The application — informal, unpaved and off-road track detection

- **Keshkamat, S.S.; Tsendbazar, N.-E.; Zuidgeest, M.H.P.; van der Veen, A.; de Leeuw, J.** | 2012 | *The Environmental Impact of not Having Paved Roads in Arid Regions: An Example from Mongolia* | AMBIO 41(2):202–205 | doi:10.1007/s13280-011-0155-3
  - Dirt-track corridors are normally **30–125 m wide** (max ~6200 m); ~3260 km² lost to corridor degradation along ~11,000 km of national routes (mean width 164 m); **full revegetation takes 10–15 years** after a track falls out of use.
  - Supplies two of this project's load-bearing priors at once — the braiding mechanism and a Mongolia-specific recovery timescale. **A3 · EC · high**
- **Amarsanaa, S.; Lkhagva, A.; Chogsom, B.; Bayaraa, B.; Damdin, B.; Tsooj, B.; Nyamjav, J.; Baival, B.; Jamsranjav, C.** | 2022 | *Quantifying the Spatial Extent of Roads and Their Effects on the Vegetation in Mongolia's Gobi Desert* | Land 11(6):820 | doi:10.3390/land11060820
  - Road length nearly doubled 2010–2020; **42% of dirt road is a single track, 58% is 3–4 parallel tracks averaging 26.5 m wide**; vegetation near unpaved roads is measurably stressed.
  - Same sensor, same country, same object class. The 26.5 m mean is 2.6 Sentinel-2 pixels and is the best available width prior for the Gobi site. **A3 · EB · high** (author list truncated at six in one record; nine appear correct)

  - Object-based random forest over PlanetScope/RapidEye/Landsat back to 2005; grassland disturbed by dirt roads and oil infrastructure **grew 88% since 2005**.
  - A directly comparable methodological alternative — object/texture features rather than one change index, which sidesteps the sign problem entirely. **A3 · EB · high**

  - Curvelet + active-contour + fuzzy pipeline on 50 cm imagery: **77.5% completeness, 89.2% correctness, 79.5% overall**; tracks and animal paths co-occur (r = 0.75).
  - A useful comparison point for a non-learned linear-feature extractor on informal tracks, and it names **animal paths** as a confound stratum this project did not carry. A different sensor (50 cm), dataset and landscape does **not** mathematically bound this project's achievable scores in either direction. Corrected 2026-09-24. **A3 · EB · high**

  - Directional template line detection, **line updating by reappearance frequency across dates**, Hough connection, then characterisation, over four Alberta sites.

  - Produces a **2.5 m output map** from 10 m Sentinel-2 inputs by super-resolution mapping, using learned spatial relationships and fine-resolution training labels; reports better results for elongated rural roads than spectral-only methods.
  - Output grid spacing is **not** a demonstrated minimum detectable road width, and the training regime is not available here. It establishes that sub-pixel mapping is possible in principle; it does not establish reliable detection of a 2.5 m low-contrast Gobi track. This project's minimum detectable width remains **unmeasured**. Corrected 2026-09-24. **A2 · EB · high**

  - Climate, not overgrazing, explains most change in Mongolian rangeland productivity.

  - Sentinel-1 **interferometric coherence**, with weather predictors and random forest, for grazing-induced vegetation breakpoints in Mongolian rangeland.
  - A Mongolian coherence application, **not** a validation of road-abandonment detection. Note also that Earth Engine's `COPERNICUS/S1_GRD` is detected backscatter, **not** coherence: coherence needs complex SLC pairs and separate interferometric processing, so this is a separate data pipeline to scope, not a drop-in channel.

  - States that multiscale **Frangi** vesselness cannot cope with crossings or bifurcations, because the image-domain Hessian supports one orientation per location, and fixes it by lifting to orientation scores.
  - **Motivates** looking for enhancement loss at crossings, but does **not** diagnose this implementation: `ridge_strength` is Sato-like, `max(0, -λ_min)·σ²`, and does not implement Frangi's eigenvalue-ratio suppression. `extract_candidates` separately rejects low-elongation components, so the observed crossing failure has at least three candidate stages and has not been attributed to any of them.

  - The **geometric median** preserves the inter-band spectral relationship that a per-band median destroys.

## 13. Reference data — OpenStreetMap completeness, ghost roads, and weak labels

- **Barrington-Leigh, C.P.; Millard-Ball, A.** | 2017 | *The world's user-generated road map is more than 80% complete* | PLoS ONE 12(8):e0180698 | doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0180698 (correction 2019, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0224742)
  - Two independent methods put OSM at ~83% complete globally; more than 40% of countries fully mapped; and completeness has a **U-shaped relationship with population density** — both sparsely populated areas and dense cities are best mapped.
  - **Cuts both ways for this project.** It quantifies incompleteness, but the U-shape weakens a naive "Mongolia is sparse therefore OSM is poor there" argument. Extract the Mongolia-specific value from the supplementary data rather than citing the global average. **A3 · EA · high**

  - Global and national road datasets contained on average only **11–14%** of the roads in regional or volunteered data, worst in less-developed areas.
  - The most concrete number for "any reference layer you condition on is a small subset of reality" — and it inverts the usual framing, since volunteered data often has **more** roads than authoritative global layers. **A3 · EB · high**

  - ~7,000 hours of mapping over 1.42 million plots found roads **3–6.6× longer** than in leading datasets, and ghost-road density was the strongest correlate of forest loss, almost always preceding it.
  - The headline quantified-extent citation and the strongest justification for building a screening tool at all — but it is tropical forest, not drylands. **A2–3 · EB · high**

## 14. Linear non-road confounds — the fabrication failure class

  - Predicts centreline and footprint for "roads, pipelines, seismic lines, and power lines" as **one detectable class**.
  - From the authors' own framing: this project's confound set is not a corner case, it is what geometry-driven linear extractors actually detect. **A3 · EB · high**

  - Deep segmentation of **Sentinel-2** for boreal linear disturbances treats roads, seismic lines and pipelines together, and reports thin disturbances as the hard case at this resolution.
  - The direct published precedent for this project's fabrication failure, at the same resolution: at 10 m the model cannot separate road from seismic line. **A3 · EC · high, preprint**

  - Wadi extraction reaches ~95% accuracy, but commission errors occur mainly in non-wadi features falsely enhanced by water indices — **specifically roads** — and wadis have inconspicuous spectral contrast, causing frequent false alarms.
  - **The mirror image of this project's river-bank fabrication, in an arid landscape.** Dry drainage channels and unpaved tracks are interchangeable at moderate resolution, so a road detector over the steppe will return dry channels. **A3 · EB · high**

  - ~34,700 km of fence at mean density **0.93 km/km²** (max 14.9), validated on 330 road transects — and the fence model was built partly **from road layers**.
  - At about a kilometre of fence per square kilometre in comparable grazing country, fence lines are a pervasive background signal, not a rare confound, and they are spatially coupled to roads. **A3 · EB · high**
