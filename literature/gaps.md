# Gaps — what the literature does not settle

These are gaps from the historical detector review, not an active task queue.
The detector is inactive and superseded under the [roadmap](../ROADMAP.md). The
[UCI trip probe](../evidence/route-feasibility-20261004/README.md) is separate
parsing evidence and does not resolve independent speed-label qualification,
geographic transfer or Mapillary metadata reuse rights. Current metadata terms
remain unresolved; an imagery licence cannot be assumed to cover every metadata
use. No commercial data product is established.

Absence of found evidence is not evidence of absence. Everything below is either a search failure
or a real hole in the literature, and the two are distinguished where possible.

## Gaps for the current question (2026-10-09)

1. Per-origin decisions (definite, excluded, unresolved) for a real flood, with bounds justified by
   data and closures that are correlated, were not found in the 2026-10-09 review (abstract-level,
   web search only, forward citations not searched). The nearest work found is Petricola 2022
   (development baseline), Li 2026 (active verification as information purchase) and Robert 2026
   (real-flood accessibility change); see
   [bibliography section 15](bibliography.md#15-healthcare-access-under-road-closure-uncertainty-added-2026-10-09).
2. Whether the Robert et al. 2026 data are released or usable for this repository has not been
   checked.

## Things this project must establish itself

1. **Not located in this review: any paper quantifying the effect of missing years on a bi-temporal
   or z-score change estimate.** The closest hits were gap-filling and reconstruction work. This
   project's ">= 2 valid recent years" rule therefore has no cited basis — which makes it an
   **engineering choice requiring validation**, not automatically a novel contribution. Run the
   enumeration and the sensitivity before describing it either way.
2. **Not located in this review: any analysis of an L1 dilation band as an evaluation tolerance**,
   or of the sensitivity of completeness and correctness to buffer width. The 2-pixel choice rests only on Heipke 1997's
   qualitative trade-off statement. Wiedemann 2003's redundancy caveat applies and is unaddressed.
3. **Not located in this review: an OpenStreetMap completeness study for Mongolia or Central Asian
   steppe.** The nearest
   are Iran (Minaei 2020) and China (Zhang 2015). The Mongolia-specific figure should be extracted
   from Barrington-Leigh & Millard-Ball's supplementary data rather than inferred from the global
   average — especially given their U-shaped density finding.
4. **Not located in this review: a confusion matrix with "river bank" as a class in a road
   detector.** Liu 2016 and Lu 2024 document the confusion qualitatively and in the mirror
   direction. Whether this is a hole in the literature or a limit of this search is unresolved.
5. **Not located in this review: a head-to-head benchmark of Hessian ridge filters on satellite
   roads.** The filter lineage is medical imaging. Whether the comparison exists was not established.
6. **Not located in this review: pre-registration practice in remote sensing.** Two targeted
   searches returned nothing, which is weak evidence of absence, not an empty set. The nearest anchors are geography reproducibility (Nüst & Pebesma 2021) and the ecology
   adaptation (Parker 2016). Do not claim precedent for "pre-registered remote sensing" without a
   deeper search of the OSF registries and EarthArXiv.
7. **Not located in this review: any study of what resampling a 20 m shortwave band to 10 m does to
   a narrow-feature index.** This is now a named diagnostic rather than only a gap — see C19 in the
   [claim ledger](claim-ledger.md).

## Engineering hazards named by the literature and checked here (2026-09-22)

| hazard | source | checked | result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sentinel-2 Processing Baseline 04.00 radiometric offset (25 Jan 2022) falls **between** the 2018–2021 and 2023–2026 windows and creates a false step change | ESA/Copernicus documentation, not a peer-reviewed paper | `gee/ndvi_change.js` | **passes** — uses `COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED`, which rescales post-2022 reflectance to the earlier convention |
| Forming a band ratio from **per-band medians** is not the same estimator as summarising per-acquisition indices; the operations do not commute | Roberts, Mueller & McIntyre 2017 | `julyS2` medians B2/B3/B4/B8/B11, then `julyComposite` computes NDVI and BSI from those medians | **applies, magnitude unmeasured** — a hand-derived counterexample confirms the operations differ (red [0.10, 0.40, 0.30], NIR [0.20, 0.50, 0.90]: ratio-of-medians 0.25, median-of-ratios 1/3). Which estimator is better here is **not** established; a geometric median is itself an estimate rather than an observed spectrum, while a medoid selects a real observation |
| BRDF is the largest uncontrolled term in time-series consistency | Qiu 2019 | pipeline | **applies** — no BRDF correction is present |
| The default Sen2Cor scene-classification mask is the weakest of the common options (84% vs MAJA 91%, FMask 90%) | Baetens 2019 | `maskS2` | **worth testing** — Cloud Score+ (Pasquarella 2023) runs natively in Earth Engine and allows weighting rather than hard masking |
| Cloud-mask models report weakness specifically on **road** and urban surfaces | Wright 2024 | — | named hazard for a pipeline whose targets are bare linear tracks |

## Clusters that are thin, and why

The session's shared web-search budget (200 calls) was exhausted partway through. Several searches
finished through the Crossref and OpenAlex APIs, which verify bibliographic fields precisely but
**discover** far less well — they can only confirm papers already named. The following are therefore
"correctly transcribed but not exhaustively discovered":

- Research-integrity and pre-registration (biased toward canonical works recalled by name).
- Google Earth Engine reproducibility (platform and bibliometric reviews only; no pitfalls paper).
- Seismic-line and pipeline detection outside the Alberta and boreal cluster.
- Railway-versus-road confusion: searched, returned noise, nothing usable.

## Not searched at all

- **Non-English literature.** Mongolian, Russian and Chinese-language work on Gobi and Inner
  Mongolian track corridors is almost certainly substantial and entirely absent here.
- **Synthetic aperture radar** beyond two incidental hits (Stewart 2020, Ji 2025). Sentinel-1
  backscatter and coherence are plausibly more sensitive to compaction than optical indices and
  would sidestep the recovery-sign problem. This is the largest unexplored methodological branch.
- **Biological soil crusts**, which strongly affect both NDVI and bare-soil indices in drylands.
- **Grey literature**: World Bank and Asian Development Bank transport assessments, Mongolian
  government road inventories — any of which might already contain the ground-truth corridors this
  project is trying to detect.
- **Neuron tracing** (APP2, Vaa3D, Rivulet, the DIADEM challenge), which solves the same
  one-path-versus-tree problem in a parallel field.
- **Archaeology and open-source-intelligence track mapping**, and desert braided-track
  geomorphology.

## Source access levels

Correction 2026-09-24: this review did not previously record **how much of each source was read**.
Entries were graded from a mix of full text, abstracts, and bibliographic records, and an
independent-validation grade was in some cases awarded from a Crossref record alone, which cannot
support it. Where a grade rests on metadata only, it should be read as *unverified*, not as
evidence strength. Roughly a third of the findings in `bibliography.md` come from abstracts or index
records rather than full text, because publisher sites returned access errors throughout.

## Method limitations of this review

No protocol was registered in advance, there was no second reviewer, and database coverage is not
guaranteed. Aboutness and evidence grades were assigned from abstracts and search results, not from
reading methods sections — including the grade A assignments. Findings for roughly a third of
entries come from abstracts or index records rather than full text, because publisher sites
returned access errors throughout. This folder can show an idea is distinct within what was
retrieved; it cannot establish that anything here is globally novel.
