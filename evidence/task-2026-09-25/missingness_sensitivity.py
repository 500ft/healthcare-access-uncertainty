"""Exhaustive enumeration of how missing recent years change the persistence decision.

MODEL_CHECKED, not EARTH_ENGINE_VERIFIED. The real per-pixel persistence calculation lives in
gee/ndvi_change.js and runs on Earth Engine; this is a small arithmetic model of the same decision
rule, plus static assertions binding it to the operators and constants in that source. If the
source changes, the binding assertions fail rather than leaving a stale model quietly green.

Rule, as read from gee/ndvi_change.js:
  disturbed(year)  <- yearlyComp.gt(YEARLY_EFFECT_MIN)        strictly greater than 0.02
  persistence pass <- persist.gte(PERSISTENCE_MIN)            k/n >= 2/3, i.e. 3k >= 2n
  eligibility      <- validCount.gte(MIN_VALID_RECENT_YEARS)  n >= 2
A masked year is absent from both k and n. It is never imputed as a quiet observation.
