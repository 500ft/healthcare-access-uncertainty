# Analysis modules

The current module is `catanroads.access_bounds`, reproduced through
[`run_access_demo.py`](run_access_demo.py). Follow the repository
[README](../README.md#getting-started) for current installation and commands,
and [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) for prerequisites.

## Retained detector reproduction

> Retained detector history. Its active questions are superseded by the
> healthcare-access software pivot. See the [history index](../docs/history/README.md).

Turns a surface-disturbance raster into **candidate corridor line-segments**. This
is the Phase-2 baseline from [`../docs/design.md`](../docs/design.md): a multiscale
Hessian **ridge filter** enhances elongated features, then **connected components**
are kept only if long and elongated enough to be corridor-scale — rejecting round
blobs and isolated noise. Each survivor is delivered as one interior-biased
polyline (`path_px`, with `path_length_px`) routed through the component along a
distance-transform-weighted shortest path (CR-09); the legacy straight chord
(`endpoints_px`) and the component extents (`length_px` major axis, `width_px` minor
axis, **not** road width) are kept as diagnostics. One route per component: junctions,
loops and braided topology are not resolved. `to_geojson` emits the path; endpoint-only
candidate dictionaries still export, and a malformed present `path_px` raises
`ValueError` rather than falling back to the chord.

Reproduction requires `python -m pip install -e "analysis[dev,detector]"` from
the repository root. The optional detector stack retains numpy and scipy.
The unused future-pipeline dependency bundle has been removed.

> **Gate.** Per the project's go/no-go rule, this extractor is **not** applied to
> real imagery until the Phase-1 disturbance signal survives its negative control.
> It is developed and validated on synthetic corridors, where ground truth is known.

## Run

```bash
# tests
python -m pytest tests

# synthetic method demonstration -> ../results/method_demo_synthetic.png
python demo_synthetic.py
```

## Use

```python
from catanroads.extract import extract_candidates, to_geojson
from catanroads.synthetic import make_scene

disturbance, _ = make_scene()          # or your own 2-D array
candidates = extract_candidates(disturbance)
geojson = to_geojson(candidates, transform=None)   # pass a (x,y)->(lon,lat) fn for geo output
```

## Tests

`tests/test_extract.py` checks, on synthetic scenes with known truth, that the
extractor recovers corridors, **rejects a road-free noise scene (0 false corridors)**,
rejects a round blob, and emits valid GeoJSON — the tooling analogue of the
negative-control gate.
